# 1 Summary
* **Study Overview:** This study (N = 220) investigates the relationship between first-generation college status and values categorized as self-transcending (other-related) and self-enhancing (self-related). It also explores whether similar patterns exist between the subjective "ladder" measurement of socio-economic status (SES) and these values, as well as the potential impact of compassion and affirmation manipulations on these relationships.  
* **Measurement of Values:** The pursuit of other-related values was assessed by calculating the mean scores of "Value_T1_scale_Compassion_Kindness," "Value_T1_scale_Family_Friends," and "Value_T1_scale_Spirituality." Similarly, self-related values were measured using the mean scores of "Value_T1_scale_Power_Status," "Value_T1_scale_Wealth," and "Value_T1_scale_Fame." The same constructs were measured at T3, and these scores were analyzed to determine differences across groups based on first-generation status and subjective SES.  
* **Key Findings:** The results indicated that first-generation status was strongly associated with other-related values, while subjective SES was strongly associated with self-related values.  
  + **Other-Related Values:** First-generation participants (n = 74) rated other-related values as more important than continuing-generation participants (n = 83), with no-college participants (n = 63) rating these values even higher.  
  + **Self-Related Values:** A higher perceived SES was related to a greater emphasis on self-related values.  
* **Consistency with Previous Research:** The relationship between first-generation status and self-transcending values aligns with previous findings (e.g., Covarrubias & Fryberg, 2015). First-generation students often experience more family achievement guilt than continuing-generation students, due to feeling privileged within their families. However, when first-generation students reflect on helping their families, they report less guilt. These findings resonate with the emphasis on self-transcending values (Compassion_Kindness, Family_Friends, and Spirituality) observed in the current study.

# 3 Variables  
  
## 3.1 First-generation College Status  
Being a first-generation college student means that your parent(s) did not complete a 4-year college or university degree, regardless of other family member's level of education.  
If we want to select people who are/were first-gen college students, "mother_final_edu" and "father_final_edu" are supposed to be >=4 (College), and they need to have completed 16 or more years of education ("eduyrs">=16), or they haven't completed 16 years of education but aspire to get a college degree ("self_expected_edu">=4).  
If one of the parents' highest education level is missing, then that person is assumed to be raised in a single-parent family, and the single parent's highest education level is enough to determine the person's first-generation status. In this data set, a participant didn't fill in parents' education info but explicitly indicated their first-gen identity in response to "writing", so that participant was also included in the first-gen group.  
  
Explanations for the values in the "first_gen_college" column:  
1: no college  
2: first gen  
3: continuing gen

## 3.2 Value scores  
People rated the importance of 6 values. 3 of them were self-transcending and 3 self-enhancing.  
For now, let's call them "self" and "other" values and create mean scores as "value_other_T1" and "value_self_T1" variables.  
Overall, the participants (N=220) scored higher in value_other_T1 (*M* = 8.47, *SD* = 1.46) than in value_self_T1 (*M* = 4.45, *SD* = 2.10).  
  
```{r eval=TRUE}

## 3.4 A correlation table for first-gen status, SES, other-related values, and self-related values  
The correlation table indicates that there isn't association between first-gen status and SES, and there isn't association between other-related and self-related values.  
There is a weak positive correlation (r = 0.23) between SES and self-related values, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001). This suggests that although the relationship is weak, it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance, indicating that higher SES is associated with higher scores on the self-related values.  
There is a weak negative correlation (r = -0.23) between first-gen status and other-related values, which is statistically significant (p < 0.01). This suggests that although the relationship is weak, it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance, indicating that a lower status regarding the college degree accessibility is associated with higher scores on the other-related values.  
```{r eval=TRUE}

## 3.5 Condition and a new variable "cond_affirm" (*For EPA submission: Only focused on A = affirmed with the highest ranked value)  
For the Affirmation and Control conditions, some people were affirmed with self-related values and others other-related values, regardless of their conditions. This is because A involved affirming with the participant's highest ranked value, and C involved affirming with the participant's lowest ranked value. We are interested in how people reason about their highest ranked value in this study.  
  
"condition":  
A = affirmed with the highest ranked value  
C = affirmed with the lowest ranked value  
M = did compassion practice  
```{r eval=TRUE}

### 3.5.1 Distribution of participants in each condition/cond_affirm by their first-gen status/SES  
  
```{r, results='hide'}

# 4 First-gen status, SES, and T1 values  
We are interested in whether the first-gen status or subjective measures of SES, or both predicted participants' pursuit of other-related (or self-related) values at T1.  
  
## 4.1 First-gen status and values
  
### 4.1.1 First-gen status and other-related values  
According to the results of ANOVA and linear regression (N=220), compared to the no-college group, continuing-gen group had a lower value_other_T1, \( $\beta$ = -0.79, SE = 0.24, t = -3.33, p < 0.01 \), and compared to the first-gen group, continuing-gen group also had a lower value_other_T1, \( $\beta$ = -0.62, SE = 0.23, t = -2.70, p < 0.01 \). There's no significant difference between no-college and first-gen groups, \( $\beta$ = -0.18, SE = 0.24, t = -0.73, p = 0.47 \).  
The pattern was demonstrated in the bar plot.

```
  
### 4.1.2 First-gens status and self-related values    
According to the results of ANOVA and linear regression (N=220), regarding the means of self-related values, there's no significant difference between the three groups. The ANOVA results indicated no significant effect of group, \( F(2, 217) = 1.24, p = 0.29, η² = 0.01 \).  
The bar plot showed that both first-gen and continuing-gen groups attributed slightly greater importance to self-related values than no-college group.

```
  
## 4.2 SES and values  
We are interested in whether the subjective measures of SES predicted participants' pursuit of other-related (or self-related) values.  
  
### 4.2.1 SES and other-related values  
The results of ANOVA and linear regression (N=220) indicated that the pursuit of other-related values doesn't demonstrate any significant difference across different levels of SES. The relationship between `SES` and `value_other_T1` was not significant, \( $\beta$ = -0.03, t = -0.52, p = 0.61 \).  
  
```{r eval=TRUE}
summary(aov(value_other_T1 ~ as.factor(SES), df_PA2))
summary(lm(value_other_T1 ~ SES, df_PA2))
```
  
### 4.2.2 SES and self-related values  
The results of ANOVA and linear regression (N=220) indicated that participants of higher SES attributed significantly greater importance to self-related values, \( $\beta$ = 0.25, t = 3.55, p < 0.001 \).  
The bar plot demonstrated the overall positive relationship between SES and pursuits of self-related values.  
```{r eval=TRUE}
summary(aov(value_self_T1 ~ as.factor(SES), df_PA2))
summary(lm(value_self_T1 ~ SES, df_PA2))
```
```{r eval=TRUE}
ggplot(df_PA2, aes(x = as.factor(SES), y = value_self_T1, fill = as.factor(SES))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", position = "dodge", color = "black") +  # Add black borders
  labs(title = "Mean score of self-related values by SES",
       x = "SES",
       y = "Average self-related values") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(gray.colors(10))) +  # Reverse shades of gray
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.grid = element_blank())  # Remove grid lines

```
  
## 4.3 Values with both first-gen status and SES   
The analyses of variance indicated that first-generation status was the only predictor of other-related values at T1, and that SES was the only predictor of self-related values at T1.  
  
### 4.3.1 Other-related values with both first-gen status and SES  
The analysis of variance and regression results revealed a significant main effect of first-gen college status on value_other at T1, F(2, 208) = 6.32, p = .002, indicating that first-gen status was the primary variable driving the effect. In contrast, SES did not have a significant impact, F(9, 208) = 0.52, p = 0.858.  
  
```{r eval=TRUE}
other_model <- lm(value_other_T1 ~ as.factor(first_gen_college) + as.factor(SES), data = df_PA2)
summary(other_model)
# Print ANOVA table to assess whether each significantly contributes to explaining variability in the other-related values
anova(other_model)
```
  
### 4.3.2 Self-related values with both first-gen status and SES  
The analysis of variance and regression results suggested that SES was the primary variable driving the effect on value_self at T1. The ANOVA table showed a significant effect of SES on value_self, \( F(9, 208) = 2.79, p < 0.01 \), while first-gen college status did not have a significant effect, F(2, 208) = 1.33, p = 0.267. In the regression model, specific levels of SES, SES9 \( $\beta$ = 2.97, t = 2.41, p < 0.05 \) and SES10 \( $\beta$ = 2.91, t = 2.26, p < 0.05 \), were significantly associated with value_self at T1. These results indicated that differences in SES were more influential in predicting value_self at T1 than first-gen college status.

self_model <- lm(value_self_T1 ~ as.factor(first_gen_college) + as.factor(SES), data = df_PA2)
